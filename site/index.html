<p>
We provide certain apps to merchants who use Shopify to power their stores ("<strong>you</strong>", "<strong>your</strong>"). Please note that your use of Shopify is governed directly by Shopify's legal documents. This Privacy Policy only applies when you have installed our Apps.
</p>
<p>
Our Apps include, but not limited to, the following:
</p>
<strong>
<ol>
    <li>
Recycling Manager
    </li>
</ol>
</strong>
<p>
Each App provides certain services to you as described on the relevant page on Shopify where the App is available.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR APPS.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Apps after the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy will be subject to the new Privacy Policy. If we make any major changes to our Privacy Policy and will need your explicit consent for further processing of your data, we will request your consent or your renewed consent (in case it was obtained previously).

Data we collect
</div>
<p>
Please note that the amount of data we have access to is mostly determined by Shopify's technical features and we do not have wide opportunities to limit this amount if Shopify does not allow it.
</p>
<p>
In particular, when you install the App, we are automatically able to access certain types of data from your Shopify account:
</p>
<ol type="A">
    <li>
<strong>All Apps</strong> have access to <strong>SHOP INFORMATION</strong> via Shopify's Shop API such as shop's address, domain, email. etc. The full list and descriptions of all such data can be found on the Shopify's Shop API documentation page available via <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/store-properties/shop">https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/store-properties/shop</a>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
<i>Important</i>: Please note that none of the Apps (except for the App called "SavvyCube Analytics &amp; Reports") actually download, store or in other way process any data that is a part of CUSTOMER INFORMATION and ORDER INFORMATION, but they only have potential access to this data since it is automatically provided by Shopify. The App called "SavvyCube Analytics &amp; Reports" processes CUSTOMER INFORMATION and ORDER INFORMATION since this data is required to provide SavvyCube Analytics &amp; Reports services and without processing such data SavvyCube Analytics &amp; Reports will not work the way it should.
</p><br>
<div class="mw-pl-subtitle">
    How do we use your data? 
</div>
<p>
The data we have access to is used only to provide you services. Below is a description of what data and for what purposes each App uses.
</p>
<ol type="A">
    <li>
In <strong>all Apps</strong> we retrieve <strong>SHOP INFORMATION</strong> for billing purposes and also to be able to provide service, which requires access to Shopify's Shop API scope. Additionally, for proper functioning, some Apps need other <strong>SHOP INFORMATION</strong> such as the shop's global settings, pricing plan, currency, currency format, time zone, time format.
    </li>
</ol><br>
<div class="mw-pl-subtitle">
    On what legal basis do we rely to process your data? 
</div>
<p>
Because we only use your data to provide services to you, we rely on the need to enter into and execute a contract to which you are a party to process your data.
</p><br>
<div class="mw-pl-subtitle">
    Cookies and similar technologies
</div>
<p>
We use only such cookies that allow us to make Apps usable (so called "functional cookies") - the Apps cannot function properly without these cookies. We do not use any marketing or advertising cookies in our Apps.
</p><br>

<div class="mw-pl-subtitle">
Your rights and options
</div>
<p>
We will answer your requests without undue delay and in any event within 1 month of our receipt of the request unless a longer period is required due to the complexity of the request. In this case, our response time can be up to 3 months in total.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Rights of California residents</strong>. As required by California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) we endeavour to respond to a verifiable request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by e-mail.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to opt out</strong>. Under the CCPA each California resident can request business stops selling data to third parties. However, we do not, and will not, provide your data in direct exchange for money. Therefore, you can make sure that we do not sell your data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Other rights</strong>. You also have a right to be informed about what categories of data we are collecting: you can request us to disclose what data we have collected in the past 12 months and right to get a free copy of your data disclosed in a readily usable and readable format. You can also request us to delete the data we have collected in the past 12 months. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights granted under CCPA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mandatory verification</strong>. As required by CCPA we will need to verify your identity before processing your request. In order to verify your identity, we will generally match sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems. In certain circumstances, we may decline the request, mainly where we are unable to verify your identity, for example, if you have requested us to delete your data.
